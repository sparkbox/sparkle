From your friends at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com).

## Creating a Sparkle Sub-System

- Default Sass Map with at least three example values.
- A function to access the map. 
- A value added to the settings map to enable/disable the utility classes. 
- Utility classes that meet this criteria:
    - A check for if the utility class is enabled/disabled.
    - Utility classes should be written to accept a namepspace. 
    - Utility classes should be written to loop through all of the values in the map. 
    - Loop includes media query prefixes for the class to be called at certain breakpoints. 
- Write test to check the function and class names.
- Write documentation that can be configurable to the settings.

## Adding a Sass Unit Test

1. Create a `_test.scss` file in the corresponding folder. 
    *Note* Each folder with mixins, functions, and utilities should come with a corresponding `_test.scss` file. 
2. Import True (`@import 'true'`) and sass file that would like to test at the top of this `_test.scss` file. 
3. Ensure that this `_test.scss` file is being imported into the main `test/test.scss` file.
